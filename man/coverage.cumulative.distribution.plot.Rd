\usage{
coverage.cumulative.distribution.plot(path = ".",
  pattern = "-coverage-hist.txt$")
}

\item{path}{The path to the directory containing your coverage statistics file}

\item{pattern}{A regular expression pattern. Only file names which match the regular expression will be returned}

\description{
Plot the cumulative distribution of the fraction of targeted bases covered by n reads. It needs coverage statistic files generated with the command:
bedtools coverage -hist -abam sample.bam -b target_regions.bed | grep ^all > sample-coverage-hist.txt
It is based on the code from this the post in Getting Things Done in Genetics: http://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2014/03/visualize-coverage-exome-targeted-ngs-bedtools.html

\examples{
fpath <- system.file("extdata", "sample2-coverage-hist.txt", package="iSeqsR")
directory <- dirname(fpath)
coverage.cumulative.distribution.plot(path = directory, pattern="-coverage-hist.txt$")
